# Single Leg X-Guard

Single Leg X (SLX) Guard is one of the [[Guards]] used in [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)]]. 

![500][SingleLegX.png]

It starts by one player standing with their legs on either side of the chest of the other player. The player on the ground chooses a leg to attack, and wraps the leg with that side's arm into the armpit. Then the hips are raised to then wrap the outside leg around the outside of the standing player's leg, and the inside foot sits in the crotch.

### Tips while in this position
* Try to touch heel of outer foot to knee of inner foot by really hipping up. This makes the opponent more off balanced
