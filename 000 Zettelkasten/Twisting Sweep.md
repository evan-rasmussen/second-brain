# Twisting Sweep

A Twisting Sweep is a general term for a sweep you do from [[Single Leg X-Guard]]. 

* From SLX, you twist toward the outside foot side, causing the top player to tip to their butt. You can also grab the sleeve of the captured side with your opposite side hand to prevent posting while falling.
* You use a twisting sweep **when the top player has their un-captured foot too far back or too far to the side of the captured foot.**
* If the player has good base, you can even twist the other way, and when they come back **use the momentum** to twist toward the outside and take them down. 
* You can perform a [[Tripod Sweep]] by first dropping the foot on the hip down and drive into the ground while kicking out with the foot in the crotch to get them to come forward, exposing their back foot to grab. Return to SLX and grab the foot. Hip up and take them down.
