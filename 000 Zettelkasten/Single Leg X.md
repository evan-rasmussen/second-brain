Single Leg X (SLX) is a type of [[Guard]] used in [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)]].

It starts by one player standing with their legs on either side of the chest of the other player. The player on the ground chooses a leg to attack, and wraps the leg with that side's arm into the armpit. Then the hips are raised to then wrap the outside leg around the outside of the standing player's leg, and the inside foot sits in the crotch.
