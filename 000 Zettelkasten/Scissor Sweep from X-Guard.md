# Scissor Sweep from X-Guard

The scissor sweep from X-Guard involves the following:
1. While in X-Guard, grab the collar of the opponent with the hand that is not controlling the leg you have in an underhook or overhook.
2. Break down the opponent's posture.
3. Once they try to stand up, kick out with both legs, causing them to fall backwards.
4. Keep control of the leg you have a hold on with your arm as you come up, so they can't lock you in a closed guard.
