# Correlation Coefficient

The correlation coefficient, also known as *Pearson's r*, ranges from -1 to 1 and represents how two attributes are **linearly** correlated to one another. A -1 means they are negatively correlated, when one goes up, the other goes down. A 1 means they are positively correlated.
