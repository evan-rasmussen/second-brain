Closed Guard is one of the [[Guards]] played in [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)]].

![500][Closed-Guard.png]

It involves the bottom player wrapping their legs around the top player and locking their heels together. The bottom player's goal is to set up to either sweep or submit the top player, the top player's goal is to pass the bottom player's guard by getting out of their locked legs and around the legs.

### Tips while in this Position
* Squeezing your knees together with someone in your closed guard can help take some of the pressure off of your locked feet.
* As the top player, do not stick your arms too far up on the bottom player, otherwise you will get armbared. Try to keep "T-Rex arms".
