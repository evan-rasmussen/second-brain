# X-Guard

X-Guard is one of the [[Guards]] played in [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)]].

![500][X-Guard.png]

It involves putting the top of your foot behind the mirroring knee of your opponent, and your other foot on top of that one on the same leg, with the top pressed against the upper thigh. The leg of the upper player that is not being framed on by the feet can either be above the shoulder as shown in the picture, or it can be in the armpit.

### Tips while in this Position
* Always keep tension by opening your legs, driving the feet into where they need to be. Otherwise the opponent can just lift their leg out.

## Pulling X-Guard
1. From standing position, get a collar and sleeve grip.
2. Get the other player to step forward with the collar side foot.
3. Place the top of your collar side foot on the back of the collar side knee.
4. While driving that foot in and pulling down on the collar, drop to your butt.
5. While falling, drop the grip on the sleeve, and grab the back of the knee on the sleeve side. This can either be an over (outside) or under (inside) hook. An overhook will lead to the ankle being in the armpit, and an underhook will lead to the ankle above the shoulder like in the picture.
6. Quickly place the top of the other foot on the thigh or down low on the ankle ([[Reverse X-Guard]]).
